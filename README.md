# CookBlock.API

An AspNet.Core API for communicating between mobile app CookBlock and SQL-Database.

You need to set up your connection address to the database in appsettings.json and Properties/launchSettings.json files.

This is an old project that I won't finish. You can freely copy and fix it by yourself.
